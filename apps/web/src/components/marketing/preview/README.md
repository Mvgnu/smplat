# Marketing Preview Components

This folder contains interactive components that power the marketing preview cockpit within the admin surface.

- `PreviewWorkbench.tsx` â€“ timeline-aware workspace for navigating routes, comparing draft/published snapshots, triaging regressions, and documenting notes.

Components in this directory assume marketing preview snapshots are collected through `@/server/cms/preview`. Keep metadata comments (`key: value`) up to date so automation can track features.

## Timeline & triage workflow

The workbench consumes `collectMarketingPreviewSnapshotTimeline` output, which includes the current capture and prior manifests. Editors can scrub through captures via the left sidebar timeline, review per-route diff badges, and open regression notes for the active route. Notes are persisted through the `/api/marketing-preview/notes` endpoint and stored locally for development under `apps/web/src/server/cms/__fixtures__/marketing-preview-notes.json`.

- Use the severity selector to categorize issues (`info`, `warning`, or `blocker`).
- Notes are grouped by `generatedAt` + route and surface counts directly in the route navigation to guide triage.
- Timeline history is sourced from `marketing-preview-history.json`; running the snapshot writer appends new entries automatically.
