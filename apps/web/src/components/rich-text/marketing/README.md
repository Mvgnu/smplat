# Marketing Lexical Components

This directory hosts the presentational components used by the Lexical-driven marketing renderer. Each component maps to a marketing block `kind` generated by the CMS normalization pipeline.

| Component | Block Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HeroCallout` | `hero` | Rich hero with eyebrow, headline, body, and paired calls-to-action. |
| `MetricGrid` | `metrics` | Three-up metric grid with heading/subheading support. |
| `TestimonialCallout` | `testimonial` | Quote-centric testimonial block. |
| `ProductCard` | `product` | Pricing-style product card with feature bullets. |
| `TimelineShowcase` | `timeline` | Milestone timeline for narrative sequencing. |
| `FeatureGrid` | `feature-grid` | Feature highlight cards arranged in a responsive grid. |
| `MediaGallery` | `media-gallery` | Image and video gallery with caption support. |
| `CtaCluster` | `cta-cluster` | Cluster of contextual calls-to-action. |
| `ComparisonTable` | `comparison-table` | Columnar comparison table for plans or packages. |

All components follow the tailwind utility style system and expect already sanitized data from the CMS normalization layer.
