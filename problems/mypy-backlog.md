## Problem Statement
Running `poetry run mypy` (with or without explicit module arguments) fails because the configuration scans the entire `smplat_api` package and encounters a large backlog of pre-existing typing issues (missing annotations, invalid assignments, incorrect FastAPI type hints).

## Metadata
Status: Open
Priority: Medium
Type: Test
Next_Target: N/A

## Current Hypothesis
The mypy configuration's default include path (`src`) pulls in the entire API package, exposing long-standing typing debt unrelated to the fulfillment metrics fixes. Resolving this requires a dedicated typing remediation effort or scoping the checks before the broader backlog is addressed.

## Log of Attempts (Chronological)
- 2025-05-09: Executed `poetry run mypy` after fulfillment metrics updates. Command reported >400 errors across observability, payments, orders, and schema modules. Retried with explicit module arguments but configuration still expanded to the full package. Documented backlog to unblock the current fix.

## Resolution Summary
Pending. Requires either broad typing remediation or an update to narrow mypy targets before full enforcement.
