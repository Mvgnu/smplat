# Implementation Status Report

_Last updated: 2025-10-18_

## Overall Summary
- Storefront, checkout, and Stripe handoff are live end-to-end with configurable bundles, subscriptions, cart persistence, and fulfillment kick-off after successful payments.
- Service detail experiences now surface saved configurations, campaign price breakdowns, and CMS-driven media galleries while persisting presets locally.
- Stripe webhook ingress is instrumented with delivery/retry logging and hardened error handling; internal key gating remains enforced.
- Checkout + Stripe webhook flows now publish observability metrics at `/api/v1/payments/observability`, enabling alerting via the checkout API key.
- Fulfillment TaskProcessor emits metrics/health telemetry and now applies exponential backoff with dead-letter tracking; deployment wiring and alerting remain open.
- CMS schemas and seeding scripts are prepared; storefront marketing sections now pull from Payload by default and gracefully fall back to Sanity only when explicitly configured.
- Client-facing dashboard (`/dashboard`) now requires an authenticated session, preloads assigned orders with persisted selection, surfaces fulfillment rollups, Instagram analytics, and catalog telemetry, and exposes notification preferences.
- Billing center surfaces invoice history with CSV exports, staged rollout guardrails, and campaign intelligence overlays that correlate spend, fulfillment outcomes, and Instagram reach deltas.
- Billing center now blends invoice history with hosted checkout analytics, exposing conversion funnels, retry cadences, abandonment insights, and operator quick actions within the dashboard experience.
- Hosted Stripe checkout sessions now transition via webhook enrichment, scheduled expiry/abandonment sweeps, and operator APIs for regeneration, giving finance/support teams actionable lifecycle telemetry.
- Weekly digests aggregate order/fulfillment activity via `tooling/scripts/run_weekly_digest.py`, reusing NotificationService templates with marketing preference enforcement.

## Storefront & Checkout
**Delivered**
- Product detail page merges canonical API data with Sanity marketing content blocks (hero, metrics, testimonials, FAQs) while keeping fallbacks.
- Catalog listing exposes search and category filters over active products; results hydrate directly from the FastAPI layer.
- Persistent cart and checkout proxy map configurator choices to order creation, Stripe Checkout session generation, and fulfillment task scheduling.
- Saved configuration presets (with local persistence), granular price breakdowns, and CMS-backed media galleries enrich the merchandising surface.
- Catalog listing now supports sort-by options (price/title) and promotes CMS-defined cross-sell bundles for quick merchandising experiments.
- Catalog insights surface trending and zero-result searches in the storefront and can be exported via `tooling/scripts/export_catalog_insights.py` for merchandising hand-offs.

**Outstanding**
- Operationalize catalog insights with CMS-driven experiments (e.g., automated bundle updates) and fold the exported telemetry into merchandising review cadences.
- Build analytics + alerting for checkout/webhook success rates (Dashboards, PagerDuty/Webhook to Slack) using the new telemetry fields.
- Extend hosted session automation with proactive notifications (Slack/email webhooks) and telemetry-backed anomaly policies to complement the newly delivered dashboard analytics.
- Wire the new `tooling/scripts/smoke_checkout.py` into CI/CD once an environment can expose checkout + API key safely.

## Fulfillment & Operations
**Delivered**
- Alembic migrations through `20251015_06_webhook_events` establish fulfillment tasks, configurable product schema, and webhook event logging.
- TaskProcessor polls for fulfillment work, captures run/error metadata, exposes `/api/v1/fulfillment/{metrics,health}`, and now schedules retries via exponential backoff with dead-letter accounting.
- Order status now advances automatically (processing → active → completed / on_hold) based on fulfillment task outcomes, and progress snapshots are exposed at `/api/v1/orders/{order_id}/progress`.

**Outstanding**
- Enable the worker in deployed environments, feed metrics into monitoring, and define alert thresholds for loop errors/dead-letter growth.
- Implement service-specific fulfillment actions (Instagram delivery, status transitions, customer notifications).
- Finalize admin tooling for manual overrides and progress auditing.

## Platform & Tooling
- Turborepo structure, shared design tokens, and environment templates are in place across web, API, and CMS workspaces.
- Stripe, Payload, Sanity (fallback), and fulfillment environment variables are documented; ensure `CHECKOUT_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are populated before enabling payments.
- Database migrations target Postgres; local SQLite runs are acceptable for unit tests but staging/production must validate against Postgres before seeding.
- Payload seed script now provisions the `product-instagram-growth` marketing page so the storefront configurator instantly merges CMS copy; replicate this pattern for new services. Keep the Sanity seeding script handy only for the temporary fallback window.
- Smoke scripts (`tooling/scripts/smoke_fulfillment.py`, `tooling/scripts/smoke_checkout.py`) support an `--in-process` mode to exercise health/checkout flows without binding network ports and were validated locally.
- Sanity seeding still ships both `product-instagram-growth` and `product-tiktok-growth` landing pages to support the fallback mode; Payload seeding covers these pages for the default flow.
- In-memory async DB fixtures power 54 integration tests spanning Stripe checkout/webhooks, fulfillment task orchestration (including retry dead-letter flows), Instagram analytics updates, and order listing/filtering (current coverage **82%**).
- Local FastAPI smoke + pytest execution now runs through a dedicated virtual environment (`apps/api/.venv`) ensuring consistent dependency resolution.
- Fulfillment observability runbook (`docs/18-fulfillment-observability.md`) documents worker toggles, alert thresholds, and smoke coverage expectations.
- Catalog search telemetry now feeds an in-memory observability store (`/api/v1/observability/catalog-search`) with counts by query, category, and sort for merchandising analytics.
- CI integration blueprint (`docs/19-ci-observability.md`) demonstrates how to execute the smoke + observability checks in GitHub Actions/GitLab.
- Prometheus-formatted metrics available at `/api/v1/observability/prometheus` (secured by the checkout key) aggregate fulfillment, payments, and catalog counters for scraping.
- Grafana dashboard JSON (`docs/20-grafana-dashboard.json`) and dashboard guide (`docs/20-observability-dashboards.md`) illustrate how to visualize & alert on the new metrics.

## Automated Test Coverage
- Command: `pytest --cov=smplat_api --cov-report=term`
- Result: 54 tests passing; overall coverage **82%** (checkout + webhook endpoints, payment retries, fulfillment workflows with retry escalation, product CRUD, and Instagram analytics leverage the async DB fixtures end-to-end).
- Major gaps: `services/payments/payment_service.py` still needs staging-scale retry/backoff tests, `services/fulfillment/instagram_service.py` uses simulated Graph payloads rather than live calls, and `/api/v1/orders` reporting/logging paths remain to be validated once admin tooling arrives.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Enable the TaskProcessor in staging (set `FULFILLMENT_*` env vars), push metrics into the monitoring stack, and configure alerts for loop errors and dead-letter growth.
2. Stand up checkout/webhook observability (dashboards + alerting) using the new delivery/retry metadata and integrate smoke scripts into CI for regression coverage.
3. Expand storefront merchandising: ship CMS-authored bundles, refine catalog search/filter UX, and seed additional `product-<slug>` pages to exercise the gallery/preset experiences.

## Client Experience
**Delivered**
- `/dashboard` route group introduces a guarded client workspace layout, auto-selects assigned orders with per-account persistence, and renders fulfillment progress stats driven by `/api/v1/orders/{id}/progress`.
- Catalog observability insights (trending queries, zero-result breakdown, sample metrics) surface alongside fulfillment cards, while Instagram analytics history, sparkline trends, and notification preference toggles keep clients informed and in control.
- Notification preferences now back API-level enforcement so transactional emails (order status updates) respect user opt-outs automatically.

**Outstanding**
- Expand the dashboard with billing history, campaign-level reporting widgets, and richer Instagram visualizations (e.g., charts, comparative baselines).
- Wire weekly digest metrics into dashboard widgets and introduce configurables for anomaly alert routing.
