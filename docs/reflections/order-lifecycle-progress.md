# Reflection: Order Lifecycle Automation

## Wins
- Fulfillment tasks now drive order status transitions automatically, eliminating manual status juggling and reducing the chance of stuck orders.
- Exposed `/api/v1/orders/{id}/progress` so support and merchandising teams can inspect fulfillment progress programmatically.
- CI runs catalog observability tests and publishes merchandising insights, keeping telemetry and operations aligned.

## Challenges
- Local pytest execution still depends on Poetry-managed dev packages; reiterated guidance so new contributors install `--with dev` before running the suite.
- Determining the right status transitions required clarifying how retries and dead-lettering interact with the order lifecycle.

## Improvements
- Consider adding notification hooks (email/Slack) when orders flip to `on_hold` or `completed`.
- Follow up with backlog grooming to attach the new progress endpoint to the upcoming client dashboard views.
