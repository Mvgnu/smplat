# Reflection: Billing Reconciliation Dashboard Hardening

date: 2024-03-01
owners: finance-platform
scope: billing-reconciliation

## Wins

- Failure metadata is now structured end-to-end, simplifying incident triage and worker restarts.
- The operator dashboard consolidates runs, discrepancies, and staging activity, reducing the number of tools finance needs to open.
- Playwright coverage ensures that the triage surface keeps functioning as the API evolves.

## Challenges

- Coordinating server-side mocks for the Playwright suite required plumbing a dedicated environment variable to hydrate the dashboard without a live API.
- Maintaining state across client refreshes while surfacing action feedback highlighted the need for more robust optimistic updates in future iterations.

## Process Improvements

- When adding new operator workflows, always pair API schema changes with UI smoke tests that exercise mutations via the Next.js proxy routes.
- Continue documenting fallback tooling (e.g., mock data paths) to keep local and CI environments reproducible for finance-critical views.
