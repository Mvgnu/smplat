# Reflection: Catalog Telemetry Surface

## What worked well?
- Reused the secured observability snapshot endpoint via a server-only helper, keeping the checkout API key on the server while still powering storefront analytics.
- Shared UI patterns with existing marketing sections, so the insights block feels native to the `/products` experience.

## Challenges & Limitations
- Local pytest run failed because dependencies such as `pytest_asyncio` are not installed in this environment; lint still validates the TypeScript changes.

## Process Notes
- Fetching telemetry after recording the current search ensures the insights panel reflects the visitor's query in near real time.

## Innovations or Adjustments
- Derived zero-result rate and average results heuristics directly from the recent event buffer, giving merchandising an at-a-glance quality signal without additional backend changes.
- Tightened the pipeline by adding a catalog zero-result SLO to the consolidated checker and Prometheus metrics so CI/CD, dashboards, and the storefront share the same guardrails.

## Alignment with Goals
- Advances the dashboard/analytics goal by piping catalog observability data into the storefront, making experiment signals visible where marketers already work.

## Process Improvements
- Automate a lightweight local requirements install (or document a stub script) for observability tests so failing dependencies don’t block quick validation on new contributors’ machines.
- Schedule the new merchandising export script alongside deploys so the marketing team receives fresh zero-result and trending query data without manual copying.
