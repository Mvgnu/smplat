# Reflection: Observability CI Integration

## What worked well?
- Shipping `.github/workflows/observability-checks.yml` establishes an actionable gate that enforces observability health before promotions.
- Updating the runbook and Grafana documentation keeps staging operators aligned without re-opening other references.

## Challenges & Limitations
- Could not validate Prometheus/Grafana behavior directly within this sandbox; documentation now highlights the manual verification steps and placeholders for staging-specific values.

## Process Notes
- The structured workflow (plan + doc updates) made it straightforward to map repository variables/secrets to the automation and surface them explicitly in the docs so future iterations stay consistent.

## Innovations or Adjustments
- Introduced repository variable–driven thresholds to make the GitHub Action configurable without editing YAML, aligning with the observability SLO discussion.

## Alignment with Goals
- The changes advance Goals 1–3 from the session brief by codifying staging checks, wiring the CI hook, and sketching the analytics follow-up even though live telemetry was unavailable.

## Process Improvements
- Add a lightweight template for future GitHub Action integrations (variables, secrets, validation guards) to accelerate similar automation work.
- Extend the 5-step cycle checklist with an explicit reminder to capture staging-specific values immediately after verification so runbooks stay current.
